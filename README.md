## Overview

**Virtual Oddity** is an interactive music video in Virtual Reality, inspired by David Bowie’s *Space Oddity*.  
The project combines music, immersion, and interactivity to create a unique VR experience.  
Users enter a virtual world that evolves with the rhythm and mood of the song.  
Each interaction affects the sound layers and the atmosphere of the scene.

## Concept

- **Platform:** HTC XR Elite  
- **Goal:** To immerse users in a synesthetic VR world that responds to music  
- **Interactivity:** Users can manipulate individual sound layers of the song  
- **Narrative:** A visual and emotional interpretation of *Space Oddity*  

---

## Interaction

- Four interactive objects represent **drums, bass, guitar, and vocals**.  
- **Throwing** an object decreases the volume of its sound layer.  
- **Shaking** an object adds **reverb** to the sound.  
- **Smooth artificial locomotion** allows users to move through the environment using the thumbstick.  
- A **tutorial** introduces the controls and interaction principles.  
- The **sky** changes color and lighting in sync with the song’s segments and narrative.
